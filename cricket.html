    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a large field between two teams of 11 players. The game involves a pitch in the middle of the field with a wicket at each end, and the goal is to score more runs than the other team. Cricket originated in England in the 16th century and is now the second most watched sport in the world.</p>
